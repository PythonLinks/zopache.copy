In order for an open source project to be successful,
it either needs a huge installed base, such as Linux or LibreOffice,
or it needs a business model.  While this software does not
have a huge installed base, it does have a great business model.

You are free to use this software, and do almost whatever you want
with it, but in exchange I ask you for a copy of your CV (Resume for Americans)
and permission to process your personal information for the purposes of
recruiting. Basically if you are smart enough to understand
why this software is so good, you are a very valuable developer.

Onto the specifics. The softwre I wrote, I am licensing under a CV license.
The software which I use is generally either an MIT License or a Zope License.
If your organization really really cares about licenses, it would be good
to check the details of the different packages.  I am quite sure that there is
no GPL or LGPL.  

You can read the ZPL and CV licenses in thsi directory.
